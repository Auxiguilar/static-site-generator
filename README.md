~~The links don't work, which is on me(my code sucks), but all other things considered the thing is... 'functional'. I'm still a little confused, though...~~

The links work now. I fixed it.

- Running the tests will result in import errors.
- The markdown files with which the site has been generated are provided, and not my ramblings (though I am also a Tolkien fan, and might consider myself part of the 'club').
- The `index.md`'s are copied alongside the generated `index.html`'s due to the way it's all written (and my own laziness). They obviously don't do anything...
- It's limited to certain kinds of formatting; `_` for italics, `**` for bold, etc., and nothing for strikethroughs, or alternative ways of **bold** and *italics*, as well as no support for 'multiples' (for lack of a better word?), like ***bold italics***, and such...

Here's the [link to the site...](https://auxiguilar.github.io/static-site-generator/)
